I think the best way to learn React Native is to understand what mobile development is. I was coming from Microsoft .Net MVC core/Xamarin , so I had an idea of what building an app was about. What I mean is that I need to know the basic concepts, such as Drawer, Toolbar, TabBar, ViewPager or Button. They are pretty obvious, and I don't think it should take me more than a couple of weeks to get familiar with the components of an Android or iOS app.

`React Native` is an excellent open source framework, that uses Javascript to let us create without too much effort Android and iOS applications at once. It is reaching right now, in my opinion, a level of maturity high enough to be considered production ready.
In the next level I'll try to enhance the project with JWT to provide Authentication/Authorization services.
